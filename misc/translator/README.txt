Thank you for helping the Citrine Project by
translating Language Files!

Notes:

1. Translate the phrase between the quotes ("")
2. Check that the number of : in the phrase is the same
3. Every phrase must be unique, no duplicates are allowed (also not in a different file)
4. You may not use spaces in the translation, but you can use a thin space if you like "jumpâ€‰height:" or a dash "jump-height".
5. The order of the : must remain the same "add:to:" cannot be translated with "to:add:"
7. You may not put two : after each other ("blahblah::" is not allowed)
8. If a phrase consists of just one character, its translation must also be just one character
9. Please do not use the following symbols in your translation: { } ( ) , := <-
10.Please do not start your translation with a digit
11.Please do not use quotes in your translation
12.Please do not include an end-of-line symbol as part of your translation (most of the time this is a dot)
13.You may use any UTF-8 character you like, not just ASCII (so you can use Chinese characters etc)



If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
