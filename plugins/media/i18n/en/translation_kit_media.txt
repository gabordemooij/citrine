Translation kit for media plugin.

Edit and submit this file to add support for your language!

Howto?

1. Translate the phrase between the quotes ("")
2. Check that the number of : in the phrase is the same
3. Every phrase must be unique, no duplicates are allowed
4. You may not use a phrase that is part of the core dictionary*
5. You may not use spaces in the translation, but you can use a thin space if you like "jump height:".
6. The order of the : must remain the same "add:to:" cannot be translated with "to:add:"
7. You may not put two : after each other ("blahblah::" is not allowed)
8. If a phrase consists of just one character, its translation must also be just one character
9. Please do not use the following symbols in your translation: { } ( ) , ≔ ↲
10.Please do not start your translation with a digit
11.Please do not use quotes in your translation
12.Please do not include an end-of-line symbol as part of your translation (most of the time this is a dot)
13.You may use any UTF-8 character you like, not just ASCII (so you can use Chinese characters etc)

* I will check this for you after submitting the file
  If you want, you can check this yourself as well, look at i18n/
  folder in the Citrine source code.
 
 After you are finished, send the file to me.
 I will try to create a Citrine version with it that can run the Media Plugin,
 so you can write apps and games in your own language.
 If there is something wrong with the file, I will contact you.
 
 
Part 1: Objects

In Citrine, you write a program by sending messages to objects.
The Media Plugin adds the following objects to the world of Citrine:
 
CTR_DICT_NETWORK_OBJECT             "Network"              ~ The Object representing the Internet and/or local Network
CTR_DICT_COLOR_OBJECT               "Color"                ~ The Object that represents the concept of a color
CTR_DICT_POINT_OBJECT               "Point"                ~ The Object that represents a point in space visually
CTR_DICT_LINE_OBJECT                "Line"                 ~ The Object that represents a visual line between two Points
CTR_DICT_IMAGE_OBJECT               "Image"                ~ The Object that represents an visual image from a file like PNG or JPEG
CTR_DICT_AUDIO_OBJECT               "Audio"                ~ The Object that represents audible data 
CTR_DICT_SOUND_OBJECT               "Sound"                ~ The Object that represents a sound like boom!
CTR_DICT_MUSIC_OBJECT               "Music"                ~ The Object that represents a piece of music that can be played back
CTR_DICT_PACKAGE_OBJECT             "Package"              ~ The Object that represents an archive that may contain assets for your app or game

Part 2: Events

Event handlers are blocks of code that can be attached to events that happen during
the app or game. Citrine will notify you about these events and you can attach tasks to
them. These tasks will then execute upon the event.

CTR_DICT_ON_STEP                    "step"                 ~ Event handler for each single step in the game
CTR_DICT_ON_KEY_UP                  "key:"                 ~ Event handler for key up
CTR_DICT_ON_KEY_DOWN                "key down:"            ~ Event handler for key down

CTR_DICT_ON_GAMEPAD_UP              "gamepad:"             ~ Event handler for gamepad/joystick/gamekey button up
CTR_DICT_ON_CLICK                   "click"                ~ Event handler for clicks/touches on an image
CTR_DICT_ON_HOVER                   "hover:"               ~ Event handler for hovering over an image

CTR_DICT_STOP_AT_SET                "destination:"         ~ Event handler called when image reaches destination x/y
CTR_DICT_COLLISION_SET              "collision:"           ~ Event handler for collisions of active images
CTR_DICT_ON_EVENT                   "event:"               ~ Event handler for other/misc/future events


Part 3: Messages

Message can be send to objects to make them do things.

CTR_DICT_SCREEN                     "screen:"              ~ Displays something on the screen (i.e. in the window)

The "link:" command can also be used to connect to a system library, to access
functionality outside of Citrine. The general idea is that you 'link' or 'connect' to
a certain file to extract functions or other resources.
